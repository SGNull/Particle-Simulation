# Python-Particles
This is a small project I'm currently working on to get back into code. A while ago I got really interested in Code Parade's Particle Life simulation. I tried making my own version of it in Java (I think) but it didn't turn out the way I wanted it to. So I'm going to try and make something like it in Python. It's not going to be a copy of their project, as I'm going to be doing it from scratch without looking at their code. This is just something I'm doing to get back into coding.

I chose python because it's fairly easy to work with, much easier than I had realized. I've never made any sort of project in it though, so it will be nice to properly learn a new language.

And, of couse, the README will be edited when there's something to document. As of right now, though, it's just a bunch of code that doesn't do anything.
