# Particle-Simulation
I literally spent the whole day building the entire project from scratch again, minus some of the physics calculations.

This version can actually run with 200+ particles smoothly. It can't really do 300 though, but it's getting there.

I had to learn how to use tkinter, but it's far faster than graphics.py. I also built my own set of vector math functions. However, I think it may be just a bit slower than defining the functions within one file, but that will have to wait for testing, which hasn't been implemented yet.

As for why I didn't make the C# version: C# is a pretty annoying language to try and *do* something with. Like, it will let you code stuff all day long, and it'll look really nice, but if you try and go slightly beyond programming basics there's a mountain to climb, and half of that mountain is the VS UI. It's probably amazing for enterprise solutions, but definitely not for small projects.
