# Particle-Simulation
This project took a while to get right. A long time ago I made something like this in Java, inspired by Code Parade's Particle Life simulation here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_zmZ23grXE. Recently I made a couple of programs for my summer research using python, and it made me want to get back into coding. I figured that this would be a good project to do that, so I developed a python version of it. It used graphics.py and numpy, but because of that it was slow. The newer, "REAL" version, runs much faster because it's built directly on top of tkinter. I also almost made a version of it C#, but it was going to be way more difficult by comparison.
