# C--Particles
Ok, so the python particles didn't go very well, and I'm kinda doing this on a whim, but I honestly think it will turn out better. C# is much faster than python, especially for the sort of repetitive low-level operations that need to be done. I just have to do a complete 180 and switch back to C#. What could go wrong?

As always, README will be edited when there's something more to talk about.
